# The Long Dark: Mikes Mini Mods

Small Mods for The Long Dark.

## Installation

Requires The Long Dark Mod Loader: https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller

Copy files into your /mods/ folder. Tweak the values of *.txt files (for mods that have a .txt file).

## Faster Searching

What?

* Empty Containers are instant to search.
* Non-Empty containers are faster to search (0.6 seconds rather than 2 seconds)

Why?

* Experienced players may not want to spend ages clicking on empty cupboards and waiting for progress bars
* It's a little unbelievable that an empty drawer takes ages to realise its empty.

## Clothing Repair Mod

What?

* Repairing clothing recovers half as much condition. (You must repair clothing 2x as much for the same effect).

Why?

* This causes players to make more choices around which clothing to use and repair. Repairing good boots from low condition now takes a reasonable amount of leather.
* You can use up excess cloth to skill up repairing
* There is more to do when waiting inside
