# The Long Dark: Mikes Mini Mods

Small Mods for The Long Dark.

## Installation

Requires The Long Dark Mod Loader: https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller

Copy files into your /mods/ folder. Tweak the values of *.txt files (for mods that have a .txt file).

## Faster Searching

Empty Containers are instant to search.

Non-Empty containers are faster to search (0.6 seconds rather than 2 seconds)

## Clothing Repair Mod

Repairing clothing recovers half as much condition. (You must repair clothing 2x as much for the same effect).
