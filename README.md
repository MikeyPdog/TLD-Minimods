# The Long Dark: Mikes Mini Mods

Small Mods for The Long Dark.

## Installation

Requires The Long Dark Mod Loader: https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller

Copy files into your /mods/ folder. Tweak the values of *.txt files (for mods that have a .txt file).

## Faster Searching

What?

* Empty Containers are instant to search.
* Non-Empty containers are faster to search (0.6 seconds rather than 2 seconds)

Why?

* Experienced players may not want to spend ages clicking on empty cupboards and waiting for progress bars
* It's a little unbelievable that an empty drawer takes ages to realise its empty.

## Less Effective Repairs

What?

* Repairing clothing repairs half as much condition. (You must repair clothing 2x as much for the same effect).

Why?

* This causes players to make more choices around which clothing to use and repair. Repairing good boots from low condition now takes a reasonable amount of leather.
* You can use up excess cloth to skill up repairing
* There is more to do when waiting inside
* Wolf attacks ripping clothing is more damaging

## Sprint Costs Food

What?

* Sprinting uses 5x as much food as normal

Why?

* You can no longer simply sprint around the map, which forces players to choose when to move from location to location more (is it too cold, etc)
* Sprinting away from danger is more damaging and causes interesting decisions

## Starving Hurts

What?

* Starving (0 food) causes 5x more damage than normal.

Why?

* Deliberately starving yourself is a common tactic as you don't take much damage and you can starve all day then eat before bed and regain most of your health.
* Eating food at any time is no longer a 'waste'.
* You shouldnt have to cook everything in small chunks to avoid eating too much

## Less Calories Needed

What?

* You use half as many calories as normal.

Why?

* Designed for Interloper games alongside Starving Hurts mod. You can't starve but in return you use less calories. This produces a nice blend of gameplay.
* Works well with Sprint Costs Food also.
