			"description": "Torches are consumed if you attempt to start a fire with them, and now offer +5% higher fire success rate.\n\nExperienced players typically light fires by lighting a torch from a match (100% success rate) and then repeatedly trying to start a fire with the torch, basic tinder, a stick and no accelerant. This makes things like books and accelerant a bit pointless as you can simply retry with the same torch. It wouldnt be so bad if torch crafting was required (using cloth) but you can just pull torches from fires and extinguish them which makes them very easy to acquire.\n\nYou can still move fire from one place to the next by lighting a torch, moving to a new location, throwing the torch on the ground, then lighting more torches from it, and starting a fire with those torches. This strategy requires carrying quite a few torches though (which are heavy) and torches get blown out if its windy, so I figure this is still fine.\n\nThis works well with my TinderMatters mod.",
